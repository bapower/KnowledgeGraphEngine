/**
 * <h1>Knowledge Graph</h1>
 * <p>
 * The KnowledgeGraph program implements a simple knowledge graph engine. 
 * Knowledge graphs are an important method of capturing semantic information, 
 * and a core building block for the Semantic Web. A knowledge graph is a 
 * graph of nodes, where a node can be a subject, object or both. The links 
 * between nodes are predicates. Predicates are properties of Subjects that
 * connect Subjects to Objects.
